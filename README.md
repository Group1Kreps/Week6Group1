# STEM Source Code
Here's a guide to the source code.
There are 2 folders: "website" and "app". They're pretty self-explanatory - the website folder is for the source code of our website, while the app folder is for the source code of our app.

To download and run the website or app, click on the "code" button and click "download as zip". Alternatively, use "git clone":

```git clone https://github.com/Group1Kreps/Week6Group1.git```

This will download the entire folder. From there, you can open the individual folders. If you want to run the website, click on the index.html inside of its folder. If you want to run the app, click on the index.html inside of its folder (if you're running in a browser) or import the .apk file onto an Android device.
(Note: The app was built for the aspect ratio of a Samsung Galaxy S9. It does not automatically adjust to your screen size. Because of this, you may have to scroll.)
